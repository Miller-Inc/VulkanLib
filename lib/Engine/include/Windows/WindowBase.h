/// WindowBase.h
/// This file contains the declaration of the WindowBase class, which serves as a base class for
///     all GUI windows in the application. It provides common functionality such as initialization,
///     opening, closing, and drawing the window using ImGui. The class also manages a collection
///     of textures that can be used within the window. Derived classes can override the virtual
///     methods to implement specific behaviors for different types of windows. This class is essential
///     for creating a consistent and reusable window management system in the GUI framework. This allows
///     a developer to create new windows by inheriting from this base class and implementing
///     the necessary functionality and adding the window to the render loop in the GameInstance class.
